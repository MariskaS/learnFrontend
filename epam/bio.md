# Day 1
1. My Experience;
1. My background and what I'm doing now;

I'm a Software programmer with 8 years of hands-on experience in different domains, 
including E-commerce, pharmaceutical, and banking sectors.

### I am strong as an HTML Developer with 8 years experience, and I still like it.
I pay great attention to my code, do not forget to use comments and think about those 
who will work on the project after me.
- I have experience in development of style library instead of bootstrap 
- I also have experience as a mentor in HTML / CSS / Prerocessors, 
Git and the basics of Angular. 
 
### I became interested in full front-end development a little more than 4 years ago.
Currently, I have experience with Angular, Js, typescript, React, Vue, NgRx, RxJs. 

I'm also interested in backend development with NodeJs. 
Therefore, on my last project at Epam, I worked as part of the backend team. 
> We wrote an adapter to intercept user requests and redirect them to the new system 
and return a response back to the user.

### Last year at Epam, I participated in many non-billable projects.
1. **Agile tool kit with poker planning on React** - Team Leads received 
functionality to create and customize the planning poker sessions, where they
were able to discuss and plan features for the upcoming sprints with their team members.
1. **Demo project on angular** - this project was for the client, 
as far as I remember before the conclusion of the main contract, to 
demonstrate the capabilities of the Epam employees
1. **I helped other teams**, for example, at the end of last year I was connected 
to a project for global refactoring and connecting and configuring a webpack, 
connecting and configuring EsLint and writing unit tests on Jasmine,
1. **E-commerce application on VueJS** - it was a user form on several screens with field 
validation and logic for showing blocks with fields.
1. I helped to prepare a **training materials for EPAM's interns**.
1. **Admin panel for telegram bot on Angular** - to quickly notify group members 
about upcoming courses in Epam
1. I also helped to create **EMAIL templates** for 
branded clothing stores **and create a landing page for WeChat** (Lamer project)
1. Also **participated in internal projects** of Epam

This is not all my non-project activities in Epam, there are other projects.

### While I was waiting for a work permit
I was doing my pet projects on angular.   
I also developed an application for donations for charity - without payment. 
And if you wish, I can send you links to github repositories for some of these projects.
Example of my code: 
1. https://github.com/MariskaS/ab-test
1. https://github.com/MariskaS/app-hrupkie
1. https://github.com/MariskaS/app-lookbook

### Preferences
Mostly, I worked with Angular and HTML on my main projects and in the near future,
I plan to continue this path.
